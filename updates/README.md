## 1. Project Overview

### Brief Description

ChamaHub is a comprehensive full-stack fintech platform designed to modernize and digitize the management of savings groups (chamas) in Kenya and across Africa. The platform addresses the critical need for transparent, secure, and efficient management of community-based savings and credit associations, which are a cornerstone of financial inclusion in developing economies.

The solution combines a powerful Django REST Framework backend with a modern React/TypeScript frontend, enabling groups to track contributions, manage loans, handle expenses, facilitate democratic governance through digital voting, and grow wealth through investment tracking—all while maintaining bank-level security and compliance standards.

### Project Goals

* **Financial Inclusion**: Democratize access to financial management tools for savings groups of all sizes
* **Transparency**: Provide immutable audit trails and real-time financial tracking to build trust among members
* **Scalability**: Handle groups ranging from 5 members to thousands with consistent performance
* **Security**: Implement bank-grade security with KYC/KYB verification, AML compliance, and multi-signature approvals
* **Mobile-First**: Deliver a responsive, progressive web application optimized for mobile users in Africa
* **Integration-Ready**: Support M-Pesa and other mobile money platforms for seamless transactions
* **Automation**: Enable automated wealth management through treasury bill investments and dividend reinvestment

### Key Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Python 3.12+, Django 5.1+, Django REST Framework 3.16+
* **Frontend**: TypeScript 5+, React 19+, Vite 7+, Tailwind CSS
* **Database**: PostgreSQL 16
* **Caching & Queues**: Redis 7, Celery 5.5+

## 6. API Security Overview

| Security Measure | Implementation | Why It's Crucial |
|-----------------|----------------|------------------|
| **JWT Authentication** | Simple JWT with access/refresh token rotation | Provides stateless authentication that scales horizontally and prevents session hijacking through token expiration |
| **CORS Configuration** | django-cors-headers with whitelist | Prevents cross-origin attacks by only allowing requests from trusted frontend domains |
| **Input Validation** | DRF serializers with Zod on frontend | Prevents SQL injection, XSS, and malformed data from reaching the database |
| **Permission Classes** | Custom DRF permissions (IsAuthenticated, IsGroupMember, IsGroupAdmin) | Ensures users can only access resources they're authorized to view or modify |
| **Rate Limiting** | DRF throttling (AnonRateThrottle, UserRateThrottle) | Prevents brute force attacks and API abuse |
| **Password Hashing** | Django's PBKDF2 algorithm | Secures user credentials even if database is compromised |
| **KYC/KYB Verification** | Document upload and manual verification | Ensures regulatory compliance and prevents fraud |
| **Multi-Signature Approvals** | Required approvals count before disbursement | Prevents unauthorized fund transfers and embezzlement |
| **Audit Logging** | django-auditlog for all model changes | Provides accountability and evidence for disputes or audits |
| **HTTPS Enforcement** | SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT in production | Encrypts all data in transit to prevent eavesdropping |
| **Environment Variables** | python-decouple for secrets | Keeps sensitive configuration out of source code |
| **Error Monitoring** | Sentry integration | Detects and alerts on security-related errors in production |

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline Overview

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a software development practice that automates the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes. For ChamaHub, CI/CD ensures that every code change is automatically validated before being deployed to production, reducing the risk of introducing bugs and security vulnerabilities.

The project is configured for deployment on **Render** (recommended for beginners) with the following pipeline:

1. **Code Push**: Developers push code to GitHub repository
2. **Automated Testing**: On each push, automated tests run to validate code quality
3. **Build Process**: Backend builds with `pip install` and migrations; Frontend builds with `npm run build`
4. **Deployment**: Render automatically deploys changes from the main branch
5. **Health Checks**: Post-deployment health checks ensure the application is running correctly

**Tools Used**:
* **GitHub**: Source code repository and version control
* **Render**: Platform-as-a-Service for hosting backend, frontend, PostgreSQL, and Redis
* **Docker** (optional): Containerization for consistent development and production environments
* **pytest**: Backend testing framework with coverage reporting
* **ESLint/TypeScript**: Frontend code quality and type checking

**Benefits**:
* Faster feedback on code changes
* Reduced manual deployment errors
* Consistent testing across all changes
* Easy rollback capabilities
* Automatic environment configuration
