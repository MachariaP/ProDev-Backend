## 1. Project Overview

### Brief Description

The ChamaHub Backend is a production-grade REST API built with Django 5.1+ and Django REST Framework 3.16+. It serves as the core engine powering the ChamaHub fintech platform, providing secure endpoints for managing savings groups, financial transactions, governance, and investments.

The API is designed with scalability, security, and developer experience in mind. It implements RESTful best practices, comprehensive authentication with JWT tokens, role-based access control, and automatic API documentation via OpenAPI/Swagger. The backend handles complex financial operations including loan calculations, multi-signature approvals, and real-time balance tracking with ACID-compliant database transactions.

### Project Goals

* **Scalability**: Handle thousands of concurrent users with efficient database queries and Redis caching
* **Security First**: Implement bank-level security with KYC verification, audit trails, and multi-signature approvals
* **API Excellence**: Provide a well-documented, versioned API that frontend developers love to work with
* **Compliance Ready**: Support AML/KYC requirements, ODPC registration, and financial regulatory compliance
* **Real-Time Capabilities**: Enable live updates through Django Channels and WebSocket support
* **Background Processing**: Handle long-running tasks (emails, reports, payments) with Celery workers
* **Type-Safe Integration**: Generate OpenAPI schemas for automatic TypeScript type generation on the frontend

### Key Tech Stack

* **Framework**: Python 3.12+, Django 5.1+, Django REST Framework 3.16+
* **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 with optimized indexes
* **Caching**: Redis 7 for session storage and API response caching
* **Task Queue**: Celery 5.5+ with Redis as message broker
* **Real-Time**: Django Channels 4+ with WebSocket support
* **Authentication**: Simple JWT for token-based authentication
* **Documentation**: drf-spectacular for OpenAPI 3.0 schema generation

## 6. API Security Overview

| Security Measure | Implementation | Why It's Crucial |
|-----------------|----------------|------------------|
| **JWT Authentication** | `djangorestframework-simplejwt` with 5-minute access tokens and 7-day refresh tokens | Stateless authentication scales horizontally; short-lived access tokens limit exposure window |
| **Token Rotation** | New refresh token issued on each refresh request | Prevents refresh token theft from granting permanent access |
| **Permission Classes** | `IsAuthenticated`, `IsGroupMember`, `IsGroupAdmin`, `IsGroupOfficial` | Role-based access control ensures users only access authorized resources |
| **Object-Level Permissions** | Check user membership before accessing group resources | Prevents cross-group data leakage |
| **Input Validation** | DRF serializers with field validators, regex patterns, and custom validators | Prevents SQL injection, XSS, and malformed data |
| **Rate Limiting** | `AnonRateThrottle` (100/day), `UserRateThrottle` (1000/day) | Prevents brute force attacks and API abuse |
| **CORS Whitelist** | `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable | Only trusted frontend domains can make API requests |
| **HTTPS Enforcement** | `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`, `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS` in production | Encrypts all traffic, prevents man-in-the-middle attacks |
| **Password Security** | Django's PBKDF2 hashing with 720,000 iterations | Industry-standard password storage, resistant to rainbow table attacks |
| **Audit Logging** | `django-auditlog` on all models | Creates immutable audit trail for compliance and dispute resolution |
| **File Upload Security** | Validate content type, limit size, scan for malware | Prevents malicious file uploads |
| **SQL Injection Prevention** | Django ORM with parameterized queries | All database queries use parameterization, never raw SQL with user input |
| **XSS Prevention** | Django's auto-escaping templates, DRF JSON responses | API returns JSON, which is inherently XSS-safe |
| **CSRF Protection** | Django CSRF middleware for session-based views | Protects admin interface and any non-API views |
| **Secret Management** | `python-decouple` for environment variables | Secrets never committed to source code |
| **Error Monitoring** | Sentry integration with PII scrubbing | Detect attacks and errors without exposing sensitive data |

### API Authentication Flow

```
1. User submits email/password to /api/token/
2. Server validates credentials, returns access + refresh tokens
3. Client stores tokens securely (httpOnly cookie or secure storage)
4. Client includes access token in Authorization header: Bearer <token>
5. On 401 response, client sends refresh token to /api/token/refresh/
6. Server issues new access token (and optionally rotates refresh token)
7. On logout, client sends refresh token to /api/token/blacklist/
```

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline Overview

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automates the testing, building, and deployment of the backend API. This ensures code quality, reduces human error, and enables rapid iteration.

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Code Push**: Developer pushes code to GitHub repository
2. **Automated Testing**: 
   - Run `pytest` with coverage reporting
   - Lint code with `flake8` and `black`
   - Check types with `mypy` (optional)
3. **Build**: 
   - Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - Run database migrations
   - Collect static files with `python manage.py collectstatic`
4. **Deploy**: 
   - Render automatically deploys on push to main branch
   - Environment variables configured in Render dashboard
5. **Health Check**: 
   - Verify `/api/health/` endpoint returns 200 OK
   - Sentry notifies on deployment

### Deployment Configuration

The `render.yaml` file configures the Render deployment:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: chamahub-api
    env: python
    buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py collectstatic --no-input && python manage.py migrate
    startCommand: gunicorn chamahub.wsgi:application
    envVars:
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        fromDatabase:
          name: chamahub-db
          property: connectionString
      - key: REDIS_URL
        fromService:
          type: redis
          name: chamahub-redis
          property: connectionString
```

### Testing Strategy

| Test Type | Tool | Coverage Target |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| Unit Tests | pytest + pytest-django | 80%+ |
| Integration Tests | DRF APIClient | All endpoints |
| Model Tests | factory-boy for fixtures | All models |
| Security Tests | Custom test cases | Auth, permissions |

### Monitoring

* **Sentry**: Error tracking with stack traces and context
* **Render Logs**: Real-time log streaming for debugging
* **Database Metrics**: Connection pool, query performance via Render dashboard
